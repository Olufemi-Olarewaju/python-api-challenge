# Python API Challenge - WeatherPy and VacationPy
![Alt text](image.png)

## Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

This project aims to visualize and analyze weather data for over 500 cities, exploring the relationship between various weather variables and latitude. The analysis is divided into two parts: WeatherPy and VacationPy.

## Dependencies
Markup :    * Python 3.x
            * Jupyter Notebook
            * Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, requests, citipy, scipy, gmaps, geopy, and geoViews.
