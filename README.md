# Python API Challenge - WeatherPy and VacationPy
![Alt text](image.png)

# Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?
This project aims to visualize and analyze weather data for over 500 cities, exploring the relationship between various weather variables and latitude. The analysis is divided into two parts: WeatherPy and VacationPy.

# Part 1: WeatherPy
## Requirements
Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude:

Latitude vs. Temperature
Latitude vs. Humidity
Latitude vs. Cloudiness
Latitude vs. Wind Speed
Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship:

Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
